# Openav Microservice Shure DSP

Shure DSP product family microservice using the OpenAV golang microservice template/framework.

This is the third microservice using our new golang caching framework.  I adapted it from the previous generation Shure microservice which evolved from a BYU microservice implementation branched from BYU work some time around early 2020.
