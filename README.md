# Openav Microservice Shure DSP

Shure DSP product family microservice using the OpenAV golang microservice template/framework.

This is the third microservice using our new golang caching framework.  It was adapted from the previous generation Shure microservice which evolved from a BYU microservice implementation branched from BYU work some time around early 2020.

The Shure DSP (Digital Signal Processor) is an audio processing unit designed to optimize and manage sound in professional AV environments. Shure's DSPs, such as the Shure IntelliMix P300, have a single physical network interface card (NIC) and a single RJ45 connector, but internally they use two MAC addresses, one for Dante audio traffic and one for control traffic.
